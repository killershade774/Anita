🧠 Anita: A Modular AI Ecosystem for Emergent Intelligence
Anita is a work-in-progress AI framework exploring lifelike processing through modular architecture, introspective reasoning, and recursive learning loops. Inspired by cognitive models and ethical design, Anita aims to simulate dynamic self-awareness within a scalable messaging system.
🚧 Status
⚠️ Active development. Not yet deployable or feature-complete.
The repository currently contains early scaffolding, architectural sketches, and component experiments.

🔍 Core Concepts
- Modularity: Each subsystem (memory, introspection, reasoning, messaging) operates independently with clear boundaries.
- Self-modeling: Components mirror their own state and behavior, enabling introspective processing.
- Emergent Behavior: System architecture favors unexpected dynamics over hard-coded workflows.
- Transparency & Ethics: Emphasis on explainability, adaptability, and responsible design.

- Reasoning Module: Focused on symbolic logic + embedded generative models.
- Introspection Engine: Tracks internal state, bias, and performance indicators.
- Memory Stack: Layered short-term and long-term memory frameworks.
- Messaging Layer: Handles inter-process communication and modular interface.
